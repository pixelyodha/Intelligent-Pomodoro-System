🚀 ZenFlow Pro: Intelligent Pomodoro System
A deep-focus tool designed to combat digital distractions.

📌 Project Overview
ZenFlow Pro is more than just a timer; it is a productivity ecosystem built for the modern student. Developed for the Times NIE 18 Under 18 challenge, this tool focuses on "Cognitive Endurance"—helping users not just track time, but actively monitor and reduce their context-switching habits.

✨ Key Features
Mission-Lock System: Forces the user to define a single high-priority goal before the session begins.

Anti-Distraction Tracker: Uses the Page Visibility API to monitor and count every time a user leaves the study tab, providing a "Distraction Score" at the end of the session.

Dynamic Settings Engine: A sleek sidebar for custom time adjustments and live volume control for focus soundscapes.

Integrated Focus Suite: Built-in Lo-Fi and Ambient Rain audio to eliminate the need for external, distracting music apps.

Gamified Growth: A "Streak" system that rewards consistent focus with digital growth markers.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure and audio integration.

CSS3: Modern "Glassmorphism" UI with responsive flexbox and CSS variables.

JavaScript (ES6): State management, interval logic, and browser event listeners.

🧠 The Innovation
Standard timers are passive. ZenFlow Pro is active. By implementing the visibilitychange event listener, the app gathers data on how often a student's attention drifts to social media or other tabs. This creates a data-driven feedback loop that encourages "Deep Work" as defined by Cal Newport.
